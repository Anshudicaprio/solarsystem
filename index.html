        <h1>Welcome to our Solar System</h1>
        <h3> The solar system is a vast and complex astronomical system consisting of a star,
             its planetary bodies, their moons, asteroids, comets, and other celestial objects, 
             all gravitationally bound together. Our solar system, which is located in the Milky Way galaxy,
              is home to a diverse array of celestial bodies, each with its own unique characteristics and properties.   </h3>

          <div class="text">  <h2>The Sun</h2>
            <p>  The Sun is the central and most prominent celestial body in the Solar System. 
                It is a massive, luminous ball of hot plasma that provides light, heat, and energy to all the planets, moons, and other objects orbiting around it and
                  keeps the planets and other objects in the Solar System in stable orbits by its gravitational pull.
               It has a diameter of about 1.4 million kilometers. Its mass is roughly 333,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% 
               of the total mass of the Solar System.
                The Sun is primarily composed of hydrogen (about 74%) and helium (about 24%) by mass, with trace amounts of heavier elements like oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron, in the remaining 2%.
            Inside the central reigon, known as the core, the immense pressure and temperature, around 15 million degrees Celsius, create the conditions necessary for fusion reactions to occur.
            Energy produced in the core travels outward through the radiative zone in the form of photons which are then absorbed and re-emitted by ions in its dense plasma.

            <p>  Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun in our solar system. It is about 57.9 million kilometers away from the Sun,
     and completes an orbit around the Sun in approximately 88 Earth days. It a diameter of about 4,880 kilometers and has a large iron core that makes
      up about 42% of its volume, giving it a relatively high density.
      During its daytime, surface temperatures can reach up to around 430 degrees Celsius (800 degrees Fahrenheit), while during its nighttime, temperatures
       can plummet to as low as -180 degrees Celsius (-290 degrees Fahrenheit). </p> </div>

            <h2>Venus</h2>
            <p>Venus is often referred to as Earth's "sister planet" due to its similar size and composition. It is very similar in size to Earth, with a diameter of about 
                12,104 kilometers Venus is about 108.2 million kilometers away from the Sun and completes one orbit in approximately 225 Earth days. Venus has an incredibly dense and thick atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide (about 96.5%) 
                with traces of nitrogen and other gases. This thick atmosphere creates a strong greenhouse effect, resulting in extremely high surface temperatures.
                Venus rotates on its axis in the opposite direction compared to most other planets, including Earth. This means that its rotation is considered "retrograde." Also,
                it takes about 243 Earth days to complete one rotation on its axis.

            <h2>Earth</h2>
            <p> Earth is the only planet known to support life. It's a diverse and dynamic world with a wide range of ecosystems and environments. Its average distance from the Sun is about 149.6 million kilometers 
                which is defined as 1 Astronomical Unit (AU). Earth is a rocky planet with a diameter of about 12,742 kilometers. Its outermost layer, the crust, is divided into tectonic plates that move and interact, causing earthquakes, volcanoes,
                 and mountain ranges. Beneath the crust lies the mantle, and at the core, there's a solid inner core surrounded by a liquid outer core.

            <p> Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun in our solar system and is often referred to as the "Red Planet" due to its reddish appearance which comes from iron oxide (rust) on its surface.
                It has a thin atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide, with traces of nitrogen and argon. Numerous space missions have been sent to Mars to study its surface, atmosphere, and potential for past or present life. 
                Notable missions include the Viking landers, the Mars rovers (Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity, and Perseverance).While no direct evidence of life has been found, scientists continue to explore the possibility that microbial
                 life could exist beneath the planet's surface, where conditions might be more favorable.

            <h2>Jupiter</h2>
            <p> Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system and is often referred to as a gas giant due to its predominantly gaseous composition. It is mostly composed of hydrogen and helium, similar to the composition of the Sun.
                 Its atmosphere is made up of several layers of gas, with the top layer consisting of clouds primarily composed of ammonia crystals and other compounds. The iconic bands and swirls seen on Jupiter's surface are 
                created by powerful jet streams that separate different atmospheric regions. One of the most famous features on Jupiter is the Great Red Spot, a massive storm that has been raging for centuries. 
               Jupiter is so massive that it contains more than twice the combined mass of all the other planets in the solar system. Jupiter has a relatively short day, with a rotation period of about 9.9 hours. However, its year is quite long, taking around 11.9 Earth years to complete an orbit around the Sun.
