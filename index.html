              The solar system is a fascinating and intricate cosmic arrangement that consists of a massive star, i.e., the Sun, celestial bodies like planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and other smaller objects, all held together gravitationally.
              Our solar system, which is located in the Milky Way galaxy,
              is home to a diverse array of celestial bodies, each with its own unique characteristics and properties. The study of the solar system, known as planetary science, involves exploring the formation, evolution, and dynamics of its components. Space missions, telescopic
               observations, and theoretical models have provided invaluable insights into our understanding of the solar system's history and the broader context of the universe. Its exploration continues to reveal remarkable insights into the origins of our cosmic neighborhood and the broader universe.
               Let us have a look on its components.

                <ultype="disc">

                 <li>The Sun is the central and most prominent celestial body in the Solar System. It provides the essential energy that sustains life on Earth and shapes the characteristics of the other celestial bodies within its influence. </li>
                <li> It is classified as a star which is defined as a massive, luminous ball of hot plasma that provides light, heat, and energy to all the planets, moons, and other objects stably orbiting around it by its gravitational pull. </li> 
              <li> Our Sun has a diameter of about 1.4 million kilometers. Its mass accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. </li> 
              <li> The Sun is primarily composed of hydrogen (about 74%) and helium (about 24%) by mass, with heavier elements like oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron, in the remaining 2%. </li>  
           <li>Inside the central reigon, known as the core, the immense pressure and temperature, around 15 million degrees Celsius, create the conditions necessary for fusion reactions to occur.  In this reaction, hydrogen nuclei (protons) combine to form helium nuclei, releasing a tremendous amount of energy in the form of light and heat. </li>
            <li>Energy produced in the core travels outward through the radiative zone in the form of photons which are then absorbed and re-emitted by ions in its dense plasma.
            Above the radiative zone, the material becomes less dense, and energy is transported primarily through convection. </li> 
         <li>  Then, there is a photosphere which is the visible surface of the Sun and emits the sunlight we see. It has a temperature of around 5,500 degrees Celsius. Above the photosphere is the chromosphere, which is visible during solar eclipses as a reddish ring around the Sun's edge. </li>
             <li> The outermost layer is the corona, which extends millions of kilometers into space. It's extremely hot, with temperatures exceeding a million degrees Celsius and is visible during total solar eclipses as a faint, halo-like glow.</li>

          <h2> Planets</h2>
      <p>  The International Astronomical Union (IAU) defines a planet as a celestial body that meets three criteria: </p>
<ul>
       <li> (a) It orbits a star (in our case, the Sun). </li>
      <li>  (b) It is spherical in shape due to its self-gravity,i.e., it has achieved hydrostatic equilibrium. </li>
       <li> (c) It has become gravitationally dominant in its orbital region and has removed or absorbed most other objects in its path. </li>
    
        <p> In our solar system, there are two types of planets : </p>
      <li>1. Inner Planets (Terrestrial Planets) : These planets are smaller in size and are made up of rocks. We call them inner planets because these are closer to the Sun. These are Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. </li>
      <li>2. Outer Planets (Gas Giants) : These planets are relatively larger in size and made up of gases, often referred to as the gas giants. These are called as the outer planets as these are farther from the Sun. These include Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.</li>

                        <li>It is about 57.9 million kilometers away from the Sun, and completes an orbit around it, in approximately 88 Earth days.</li>
                        <li>It takes approximately 59 Earth days and 16 hours for Mercury to complete one full rotation on its axis, which is notably slow compared to its orbital speed around the Sun. </li>
                       <li>Mercury has a large iron core that makes up about 42% of its volume, giving it a relatively high density. </li>
                        <li>During its daytime, surface temperatures can reach up to around 430 degrees Celsius, while during its nighttime, temperatures can plummet to as low as -180 degrees Celsius. </li>
                        <li>Mercury is so close to the Sun, it won't be able to hold its own moon thus it has no moon.</li>

               <li> Venus is the second planet and about 108.2 million kilometers away from the Sun. It completes one orbit in approximately 225 Earth days. </li>
              <li> Venus is often referred to as Earth's "sister planet" due to its similar size and composition.
               It is very similar in size to Earth, with a diameter of about 12,104 kilometers. </li>
               <li>Venus has an incredibly dense and thick atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide (about 96.5%) with traces of nitrogen and other gases. This thick atmosphere creates a strong greenhouse effect, resulting in extremely high surface temperatures. </li>  
              <li>Venus rotates on its axis in the opposite direction compared to most other planets,i.e., it rotates on its axis from east to west. This means that its rotation is considered "retrograde." It takes about 243 Earth days to complete one rotation. </li>

            <p>
                <li>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only planet known to support life. It's a diverse and dynamic world with a wide range of ecosystems and environments. </li> 
               <li>Its average distance from the Sun is about 149.6 million kilometers which is defined as 1 Astronomical Unit (AU). This distance from the Sun allows for temperatures that are suitable for a variety of habitats. The average temperature of the Earth (15 degree Celcius) is a fundamental part of what allows it to be habitable. </li>  
              <li>It takes 365 days to complete one revolution around the Sun which is defined as a year and completes one full rotation on its axis in 24 hours, which defines a day.</li> 
               <li> While the rotation goes on, some parts of the planet are facing the Sun whereas the opposite parts are not. This defines the day and night patterns on a planet. Also, these two times define the concepts of sunrise and sunset.</li>
               <li> Earth's axis is tilted about 23.5 degrees relative to its orbital plane around the Sun. During the revolution, this tilt causes different parts of the planet to receive varying amounts of sunlight, leading to the distinct seasons we experience.</li>
               <li>  Earth is a rocky planet with a diameter of about 12,742 kilometers. Its outermost layer, the crust, is divided into tectonic plates that move and interact, causing earthquakes, volcanic eruptions. Beneath the crust lies the mantle which is semi-solid and drives 
                 plate tectonics and other geological activities, and then there is the core which is a solid sphere of iron and nickel under immense pressure and temperature due to its depth. </li>
                 <li>Its atmosphere is a mixture of gases that extends several hundred kilometers above the surface and is composed mainly of nitrogen (about 78%) and oxygen (about 21%), with trace amounts of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and noble gases. </li>
                 <li>Earth has got one natural satellite or moon which is  simply known as "the Moon". </li>

            <p> <li>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun in our solar system and is often referred to as the "Red Planet" due to its reddish appearance which comes from iron oxide (rust) on its surface. </li> 
                <li>It has a diameter of about 6,779 kilometers. It has a thin atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide, with traces of nitrogen and argon. It completes one rotation on its axis in 24.6 hours. </li>
                <li>It is 228 million kilometers away from the Sun and completes one revolution around the Sun in approximately 687 days.</li>
               <li>Mars's significant orbital eccentricity and axial tilt cause large seasonal changes to the polar ice caps' coverage and temperature swings between -110 °C to 35 °C on the surface.</li>
             <li>Numerous space missions have been sent to Mars to study its surface, atmosphere, and potential for past or present life. 
               Notable missions include the Viking landers, the Mars rovers (Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity, and Perseverance). </li>    
               <li>  While no direct evidence of life has been found, scientists continue to explore the possibility that microbial life could exist beneath the planet's surface, where conditions might be more favorable. </li>

            <p> 
                <li>Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system with a diamter of 139,820 kilometeres. </li>
               <li> It is predominantly composed of hydrogen and helium, similar to the composition of the Sun. Its atmosphere is made up of several layers of gas, with the top layer consisting of clouds primarily composed of ammonia crystals and other compounds. The iconic bands and swirls seen on Jupiter's surface are created by powerful jet streams that separate different atmospheric regions. </li> 
                 <li>One of the most famous features on Jupiter is the Great Red Spot, which is more than twice the size of Earth. It is a massive storm that has been raging for centuries. </li> 
                 <li> It is 742.49 million kilometeres away from the Sun and makes a complete orbit around it, in 4,333 Earth days. One year here is as long as 12 years on Earth but it has a rotation period of about 10 hours.</li>
              <li>Jupiter is so massive that it contains more than twice the combined mass of all the other planets in the solar system. </li> 
              <li> Due to its enormous gravitational field, Jupiter plays a protective rolefor us. By deflecting comets and asteroids that might otherwise hit Earth, it helps to create a more stable environment for life to evolve here. </li>
              <li> Since this giant planet commands thousands of small objects in its orbit, it is estimated that it has 95 moons.</li>

         <li>  It is known for its spectacular ring system which is composed of numerous individual rings that are thin and primarily made of ice particles or rocky debris ranging in size from tiny grains to larger chunks. Together, these rings give a very stunning look to the planet. </li>
         <li>It is a gas giant which primarily consists of hydrogen (around 96%) and helium (around 3%) with no solid surface. Its atmosphere features distinct cloud bands and storm systems, including its famous hexagonal-shaped storm at the north pole.</li>
         <li> Saturn is 1.4 billion kilometers away from the Sun and takes about 29.5 Earth years to complete one orbit. It rotates relatively quickly, with a day lasting approximately 10.7 hours.</li>
         <li>One of Saturn's most unique features is its hexagonal polar storm, which is believed to be created by the planet's rapid rotation and the interaction of different wind patterns. It was first observed by the Voyager

            <h2> Dwarf Planets</h2>
            <p> A dwarf planet is the planet which does not obey the third criterion for the definition of a planet. It means that it does not clear or accumulate other objects from its path. The dwarf planets are farthest from the Sun, than any other planet. These include Pluto, Eris, Ceres, Makemake, and Haumea.
                Most dwarf planets are located in the Kuiper Belt, a donut-shaped region of icy bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune, except Ceres which lies in between Mars and Jupiter.

  <li> It completes one rotation every 25.9 hours, which is similar to the Earth.</li>
  <li>Eris most likely has a rocky surface similar to Pluto. Its surface temperatures vary from -217 degrees Celsius to -243 degrees Celsius, which is extremely cold.</li>
 <li> It is often so far from the Sun that its atmosphere collapses and freezes, falling to the surface as snow or methane ice. As it gets closest to the Sun in its faraway orbit, the atmosphere thaws.</li>

            <h2> Moons</h2>
            <p>
                A moon, also known as a natural satellite, is a celestial body that orbits a planet in the space. It is relatively small 
                with respect to its planet and is held in orbit due to the gravitational attraction between them. Based on the orbits,
                a moon is classified in two separate categories: (a) Regular moon, which has prograde orbit (in the direction of its planets' rotation), lies close to the plane of its equators and is of bigger size as compared to the other category.
                  (b) Irregular moon, whose orbit can be pro- or retrograde (against the direction of its planet's rotation), often lies at extreme angles to its planet's equators and is generally less than 10 kilometers in diameter.
                 Moons come in various sizes, shapes, and compositions, and they can exhibit a wide range of features, including surfaces with craters, mountains, valleys, and even atmospheres and hidden oceans beneath their surfaces.
                  Currently, 297 moons are known to be present in our solar system. Some notable moons of our solar system are :

                    <p>The interplanetary space or medium refers to the vast regions of space that exist between the different bodies within a solar system. It includes interplanetary dust, cosmic rays, and hot plasma from the solar wind.
                        It is mostly a near-vacuum environment, and its density is very low, decreasing in inverse proportion to the square of the distance from the Sun. The temperature has extreme variations due to the lack of thermal regulations.
                        The objects in direct sunlight can become very hot, while those in shadow can become extremely cold. Additionally, interplanetary space is bathed in solar radiation, including visible light, ultraviolet radiation, and other forms of electromagnetic radiation emitted by the Sun.
All the celestial objects orbit the central star in interplanetary space following elliptical, circular, or even hyperbolic trajectories, depending on their initial velocities and the gravitational forces acting on them.
Spacecraft travel through this environment to reach their destinations, using gravity assists from planets to adjust their trajectories and conserve fuel.  It serves as a medium for the interactions between numerous components of the solar system and helps in understanding mechanisms of the same.

                    <h2> Oort Cloud</h2>
                    <p> Beyond the orbits of the planets, there are regions full of icy objects known as the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud. Similar to the asteroid belt, the Kuiper Belt is a region of leftovers from the solar system's early history. It seems to be a thick disk or a donut.
                        The Oort Cloud is a predicted or hypothetical collection of spherical layers trillions of of icy bodies, comets and planetesimals farther away than everything else in the solar system. It
                        surrounds our solar system at a distance between about 2,000 and 100,000 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, in a bubble shape. It is the most remote and unexplored region of the solar system.
                         It was named after the Dutch astronomer Jan Oort, who proposed its existence in the mid-20th century. No missions have been sent to explore the Oort Cloud yet, but five spacecraft will eventually get there. They are Voyager 1 and 2, New Horizons, and Pioneer 10 and 11.
                         However, it is so distant that the power sources for all five spacecraft will be dead centuries before they reach its inner edge. Thus, its exploration remains a challenge for future space missions.
